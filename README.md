The Progression Tracker

Introduction

The Progression Tracker (TPT) is a helpful application that will track different fitness goals for the user. The application will monitor the user’s input and output. A phrase that has been used for New Year’s resolutions or other progression track is “new year new me.” TPT helps to ensure the user keep accountability of their goals and track their progression. What better way can you kick off a “new you” then by keeping an accountability log through TPT? The overall job of this application is to create a weekly and monthly tracker of an individual’s weight and goal progression by combining their daily caloric intake and expenditure.
The TPT web application will help user stay aware and conscious of their goals. The first step of the application is to create an overall weight goal (rather gaining or losing). TPT will allow for user to set the goal and a completion date for their goal. The optimism behind this application is it will help users keep track of their progression and if necessary, the steps to change the user’s daily activities to achieve their goal. Another goal of the application is to set miniature goals for the user to achieve. No great journey is ever accomplished without smaller journey accomplishments. The application will consist of a visual goal along with the daily details.
Visual
Goal Setting
The user will initially put their information in to create a user account. This account will hold their information and data. The user account will store the data below:
•	Name
•	Age
•	Weight
•	Height
•	Email
•	Goal
•	Deadline Date
Once the user account has been created the user will then choose from a selection for their goal (Build or Lose). After the user’s selection a detail analysis will be displayed giving them information about the criteria (involving caloric data) they will need to meet to achieve their goals. After the selection they will be asked to enter their desired daily caloric intake (i.e., I eat 2,500 calories a day). After their intake is establish the progression tracker will provide them a several choices depending on their desires and goals. 
Daily Details
This area of the application will involve the user interactions and input of daily caloric count. Technology has allowed many people to have some type of fitness tracking device (smartwatches, fitness bands, etc.:) that can track how many calories are lost throughout a day. TPT will ask the user to input their calorie expenditure along with how many calories were consumed through the day. The data for each day would be presented as follows:
•	Day 1:
o	Intake: 2,234
o	Expend: 2,400
o	Result: -166
•	Day 2:
o	Intake 2,300
o	Expend: 2,200
o	Result: +100
Each week will consist of an overall calculation of the results throughout the week and provide the user a weekly summary. The user will then be able to understand their results and track rather they are taking steps towards or away from their goals. The goals will continue to build from weekly to month and so on. 
TPT will assist the user in tracking their weekly and monthly progression until their predetermined goal date. The goal is to help provide awareness to the importance of calories when setting weight goals.
