### Limit Breaker

#### Introduction

Limit Breaker (LB) is a helpful application that will take a weight-lifting goal and current lifting weight and provide detailed workouts for users to follow. The user will interact with the application by providing a goal and a time to achieve the goal. The application will monitor the user’s input, output, and provide sets and percentages for users to lift. Many people love to go to the gym and find out how much weight they can lift for a particular exercise. Rather it is bench press, squats, or deadlift, people strive to find their limits. Limit Breaker gives the users sets, repetitions, and weight amount to help guide the user towards a new and higher max. People strive to achieve higher goals and accomplishments either through work, academics, and other areas of life. Limit breaker helps to automate the process of finding your percentage of weight and repetitions needed for a particular set. The overall job of this application is to a help user by providing a workout broken down by percentage, repetition, sets, and weight amount. Also, the application will take the users weight and height and provided them with a recommended protein percentage to see muscle growth.\
\
The Limit Breaker web application will help user stay aware and conscious of their lifting goals. The first step of the application is to create an overall weight-lifting goal and specify which exercises they would like to break their limits. Completion dates help to keep the user accountable to their goal and track their progress. The optimism behind this application is its ability to reduce the time spend by individual calculating their weight percentage based on their max weight. Each Limit Breaker goal will contain small milestones for the user to help encourage the user on their journey. No great journey is ever accomplished without smaller accomplishments being achieved. The application will consist of a **Front-End** page where the user will interact with the application providing detailed information. The application will also have a **Back-End** database that stores all the information provided by the user and calculate the needed information to ensure the user’s success.\
\
**Front-End**\
\
*Profile and Goal Setting*\
\
The user will initially put their information in to create a user account. This account will hold their information and data. The user account will store the data below:

-	Name
-	Age
-	Weight
-	Height
-	Email
-	Goal
-	Deadline Date

After the user has created their account, the user will choose which exercise will be their focus (**squats, bench press, deadlifts**). After the user’s selection the user will provide their current maximum weight in the exercise. The application will run their data and provide a percentage chart of weight amount, sets, and repetitions. The user will be provided with different choices of intensity levels. Based on the weight goal entered a detail exercise routine will be displayed giving them the foundation to help achieve their new weight max. The user will also interact with the front-end by providing daily lifting achievements, failures, and protein intake. 
\
\
**Back-End**\
\
This area of the application will involve the calculation of the weight percentages and break each weight down to a repetition amount. The process will be based of detailed workout regiments and mathematical calculations.

*Example:*

*Day 1:*
-	Current Max: 225
-	Repetition: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
-	Percentage: 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%
-	Weight: 170 lbs., 180 lbs., 190lbs., 205 lbs., 215 lbs.
-	Accomplished or Failed
-	Protein Recommendation Amount
-	Protein Intake 

Each time the user opens the application they will be able to pull their information and access their weightlifting goals and protein intake information. The user will then be able to understand their results and track rather they are taking steps towards or away from their goals.
\
Limit Breaker will assist the user in tracking their progression. The goal is to help provide awareness to the importance of percentages, repetition, and sets to accomplish new max weight-lifting goal.
